    <p>
        In this game, you will estimate a value in each round. There are
        2 rounds in which you will give your estimation. In each round, the
correct value results from the determinants
A, B, C, D and E. The determinants A,B,C and D
will be displayed to you in each round. The determinant E is a random number determined for each period and takes on a value
between -25 and 25; you do not know this number.
    </p>

    <p>
        The formula to calculate the value is:<br>
value = 2*A-B-0.5*C+D^2+E
    </p>

    <p>This formula is valid for every round of the game.
        </p>
        <p> Your PAYOFF is as follows:<br>
            max(0, 50 - |your estimation - value|) where |.| represents absolute value<br>
        <p>Your Basic Payment is Rs. 150 in addition to payoff of each round</p>
